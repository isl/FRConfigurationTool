It contains the following folders:

1)COFORM_onejar: 
  ------------
  This folder contains the necessary libs.

2)Fundamental:

  This folder contains the Fundamental Relationships per Category. For more information 
  check the "README.txt" in the ../Fundamental folder.
  It is also the destination folder for the paths created using the tool.

3)results:
  -------
  This folder is used to store the output of sparqls and templates (mostly for 
  testing purposes).

4)SPARQLs:
  -------
  The destination folder for the SPARQLs generated by the tool.


5)Templates:

  The destination folder for the templates generated by the tool.

6)src:

  The source code

7)'Disjoint_classes.conf':
   ----------------------
   This is the file where the disjointness classes are stored. 
   To define/alter a disjointness case, use the FR configuration tool and this file 
   will alter automatically.

8)'Multi_Instantiation_classes.conf':
   ----------------------
   This is the file where the multiple-instantiation classes are stored. 
   To define/alter a multi-instantiation case, use the FR configuration tool and

9)'paths.conf':
   ----------
   This is the file where we store the paths for certain files, read by the tool.

10)'rules.conf':
    ---------- 
    This file is used by the schema coverage checker, and contains lines in a format:
	A->b && c && ... 
    where A is a consequence of a rule (usually a new defined relationship) and 
	b,c,... classes from the premises of the rules.
