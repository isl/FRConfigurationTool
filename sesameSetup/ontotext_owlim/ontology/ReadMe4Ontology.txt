NOTES ABOUT ONTOLOGY FILES
--------------------------

1) Make sure that you save the ontology files in ANSI* format.

* ANSI is text codification


2) When is necessary to have an xml:base attribute, it should NOT end with a '#'. 
Sometimes may cause bad concatenation in ontotext-owlim reasoner.


3) How these files are imported and used by the OWLIM reasoner is described in 
Readme4OWLIM.txt at section 'C. CONFIGURATION TASKS>2) IMPORT NEW SCHEMA IN THE REASONER'.
